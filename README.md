JSyntrax is a railroad diagrams generator. 
It creates a visual illustration of the grammar used for programming languages. A specification file describes the syntax as a hierarchy of basic elements. 
This is processed into an image representing the same syntax with interconnected bubbles.

This is a Java reimplementation of [syntrax](https://github.com/kevinpt/syntrax/) project, originally written in Python. 

The aim of this project is to make `syntrax` tool easy to install on any operating system (no software is required for `jsyntrax` besides Java 11).

See [documentation](https://atp-mipt.github.io/jsyntrax/).
